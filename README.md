# text-generation-chatui

Middle man for connecting chatstreams to [oobabooga/text-generation-webui](https://github.com/oobabooga/stable-diffusion-webui).

Usage:
Tag the bot to create a new thread. If the tag is in the beginning of the post, tag will be removed to help clean the data before sending it to be processed. 
Afterwards, reply to the bot in the thread it creates. This will enable history.

The `â‚¬help` command can be used to list further commands. From there, settings can be tweaked.
